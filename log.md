# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have finally deployed my CarReseller project to Heroku using Node.js server proxy and was able to seed cars in the database. Everything works!

**Thoughts:**
Though I feel like it took me too long to set up server proxy and make the database work, I still accomplished this. I still feel I will struggle when I build my next project using proxy, but I will definitely struggle less.

### Day 7: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I literally spent 1 hour today updating my previous Cycle Heaven project. I used shouldComponentUpdate to avoid unnecessary rerendering. I couldn't use PureComponent because there were two properties in the state, and one of them was changing (to display loading ring). So shallow comparison that PureComponent uses always rerendered it.

**Thoughts:**
I spent almost my whole day with my son playing on the beach. I still dedicated 1 hour to build something new. I shouldn't feel bad about not spending enough time coding today, my son also wants my attention.

### Day 6: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time trying to deploy the project I did yesterday, but it didn't work. Also spent some time playing around with form validation using foundation

**Thoughts:**
I didn't spent as much time coding as I wanted today. I might set aside deploying the project, because I spend too much time on it. I'd better continue my Google Mobile Web Specialist certification courses, spend more time with CSS and start learning React Native.

### Day 5: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 4 hours on Hackerrank intermediate challenge and about 3 hours trying to understand how to deploy Create-React-App with ExpressJS and MongoDB using proxy, but neither worked

**Thoughts:**
I spent a lot of time today on both Hackerrank challenge and deployment, but my Hackerrank solution is not optimal (it is correct, at least) and doesn't get all the points due to timeout. And I still don't understand how to deploy my CRA with proxy... Well I just need to spend more time on this.

### Day 4: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day working on a project for a potential employer

**Thoughts:**
Learned about React PureComponent to prevent re-rendering, refreshed my Express and MongoDB knowledge. Have to spend some time to figure out how to incorporate server-side code into create react app and what are pros and cons.

### Day 3: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: finished 4 Hackerrank problems from Linked Lists section

**Thoughts:** Hackerrank challenges took more time than expected, basically my whole day. But I managed to also redeploy my [Farm Game](https://github.com/RomanBogatikov/farm_game) personal project to Heroku (instead of Github pages) to be able to try to supplement it with a Service Worker.

**Thoughts:** I am satisfied with myself today, especially with how fast I solved the 2 Hackerrank problems

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
