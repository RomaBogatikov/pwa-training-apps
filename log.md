# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: finished 4 Hackerrank problems from Linked Lists section

**Thoughts:** Hackerrank challenges took more time than expected, basically my whole day. But I managed to also redeploy my [Farm Game](https://github.com/RomanBogatikov/farm_game) personal project to Heroku (insted of Github pages) to be able to try to supplement it with a Service Worker.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
